# eu4.vim
This is a (very much) WIP Vim syntax file for Paradox Interactive's Europa Universalis 4 modding language.

This is the first thing I've ever scripted in Vim. As such it's primitive, but I thought this file might be useful to others and I was honestly kind of hoping for help with improving it.

Currently known lacks are:
Several triggers (notably buildings and other very lengthy lists) are lacking
Some scopes are missing
No error detection whatsoever
No support for custom scripts other than editing them in manually.
